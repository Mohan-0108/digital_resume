                <h2>Summary:</h2>
                <p>We were able to build an alcohol sensor for a car. An alcohol sensor, MQ3, Arduino interface cable, and GSM SIM 800L were used to achieve this. This alcohol sensor will determine if a person has consumed alcohol or not and, to a certain extent. In the event of intoxication, we will turn off the ignition of the vehicle and send a message to the nearest police station and family member.</p>
